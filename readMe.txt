The DnD 5e Spell Compendium is a web development project exploring ways to make spell selection more accessible to new Dungeons & Dragons players, and their DMs. Now that a fundamental level of functionality has been established, a contact page and aesthetic / UX updates are next on the slate.

Should you have any suggestions on how to improve the site or the structure of the code itself, please hold your breath, a contact page is coming.
